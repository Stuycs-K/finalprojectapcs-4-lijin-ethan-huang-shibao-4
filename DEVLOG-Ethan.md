### 2025-05-25 - Candy Class and Branches
Learned about branches (~10 minutes) and finished the Candy class according to the Uml Diagram (~20 minutes);

### 2025-05-27 - Candy types planning and Board methods
Brainstormed different candy types and colors necessary (~5 minutes) and started Board Class (~20 minutes);

### 2025-05-28 Board class initialize and display
I did the initialize method where I initialized the board with solid candies and selected random tiles to have specialCandies. I also worked on the display method.

### 2025-05-29 Thinked about the logic behind matching
I added a constructor to the board class so that the board class has a constructor. I also started adding new methods so that the matches would function.

### 2025-05-30 User input and refilling/clearing matches and the board
I did the refill method, getTileAt method, and started the checkMatches method where I take user input of the user attempting to make a match. 

### 2025-05-31 Implemented clearing matches, checking for matches and dropping candies
I rewrote the swap method to only check for candies and I wrote methods like hasMoves, checkMatches,clearMatches, and dropCandies

### 2025-06-1 debugged game,board and tile
I fixed tile to only take row and col instead of multiplying them by tileSize. For board i debugged the swapping logic and also the initialization. For Game i edited it so that mousePressed is selected at a time, and the board isnt refilled every single time.

### 2025-06-2 Testing
Tested the game in class and now next steps are animating the process, adding images of candy, and adding special candies. 

### 2025-06-3 displaying Candies
edited the candy class's display method to instead display the candy crush pngs

### 2025-06-4 Thinking about the animation
Helped outline in class how to show other blocks dissapearing following just one block disapearing. 

### 2025-06-06 Worked on editing the prototype
I edited the prototype to show the methods I added and also show how the timeline changed.
