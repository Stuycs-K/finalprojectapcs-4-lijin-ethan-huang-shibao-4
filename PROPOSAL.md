## Group Members:

Ethan Lijin and Skylar Huang
# IDEAS:

Flappy Bird: The player is a bird that has to navigate its way through narrow pathways. We will also have pipes on the bottom and top and some obstacles. 

Crossy Road: The player is a chicken that has to cross roads and avoid cars going by. 

Candy Crush: The player has to drag different pieces of candy to make consecutive threes to eliminate the candy and get a higher score.
