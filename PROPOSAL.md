# IDEAS:

Flappy Bird: The player is a bird that has to navigate its way through narrow pathways without hitting any of the pipes on the ceiling and floor. After the first 20 seconds of playing, there will also be obstacles involved such as hoops to go through or gems to collect. After a certain amount of time, there may also be moving obstacles/gems. The player's score is determined by the number of pipes they pass and then gems collected will add bonus points. The player uses the up and down arrow keys to avoid the pipes and there's a gravity aspect involved so when none of the keys are pressed, the bird automatically gets pulled toward the earth and falls down.

Crossy Road: The player is a chicken that has to cross roads and avoid cars going by. The player has to tap to move forward and use the left and right arrow keys to move sideways or the down key to move backwards. Examples of obstacles include cars. trains, and rivers. If the player remains idle for too long, an eagle swoops down and eats the chicken.

Candy Crush: The player has to drag different pieces of candy to make consecutive threes in rows or columns to eliminate the candy and get a higher score. When the candy is eliminated, the board automatically updates by randomly adding 3 more candies from the top of the screen so that all the candy is shift down by one depending on which 3 candies were eliminated. Combos of 4 or 5 result in higher scores an the game ends when there are no more possible matches to be made.
