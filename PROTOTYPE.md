Candy Crush: The player has to drag different pieces of candy to make consecutive threes in rows or columns to eliminate the candy and get a higher score. When the candy is eliminated, the board automatically updates by randomly adding 3 more candies from the top of the screen so that all the candy is shift down by one depending on which 3 candies were eliminated. Combos of 4 or 5 result in higher scores an the game ends when there are no more possible matches to be made.

Minimum Viable Product: A completed initial board of randomized colored circles that updates when three of the same color are matched. The initial board should consist of equally spaced tiles and be filled with circles at setup. There will also be a score keeper that updates automatically and a reset button that resets the board and sets score back to 0.

# Technical Details:

We'll be using classes, constructors to initialize candies, and methods to display/swap them. The game grid will be represented by a 2D array where each cell holds a Candy object. There will be multiple if statements present in each method to verify if a move is valid or if the board should update each time a move is made.
