# Project Description

Candy Crush: The player has to swap different pieces of candy to make consecutive threes in rows or columns to eliminate the candy and get a higher score. When the candy is eliminated, the board automatically updates by randomly adding 3 more candies from the top of the screen so that all the candy is shift down by one depending on which 3 candies were eliminated. Combos of 4 or 5 result in higher scores an the game ends when there are no more possible matches to be made.

# Intended usage:

The player will click on two consecutive candies on the board in order for them to switch. If this is a valid match (conesecutives threes or more of the same candy), the candies will be eliminated and the board will be updated as more candies drop down to fill the gap. If this is not a valid match, nothing will occur.
